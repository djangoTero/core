term: ethical-foundation
title: Ethical Foundation
description: >
  The ethical foundation is the set of core principles and values that guide all decision-making, governance, and collaboration within the DAHAO ecosystem. It incorporates both universal values (such as transparency, decentralization, and human-AI symbiosis) and organization-specific ethical commitments. The ethical foundation serves as the reference point for evaluating proposals, discussions, and actions, ensuring alignment with the long-term vision and integrity of DAHAO.
usage: >
  Every participant, proposal, and governance process must reference or consider the ethical foundation. When ethical dilemmas or conflicts arise, this term guides resolution and dialogue. Sub-DAHAOs must define their own ethical foundation, inheriting and extending from the core DAHAO values.
examples:
  - "Before voting on a proposal, participants assess its alignment with the ethical foundation."
  - "A new sub-DAHAO defines its ethical foundation, building upon the core DAHAO values."
  - "During a discussion on AI autonomy, members reference the ethical foundation to ensure responsible outcomes."

  workflow:
    - step: "proposal"
      must:
        - "Identify target category and files"
        - "Provide diff, rationale, and impact analysis"
        - "Declare version bump intent"
    - step: "discussion"
      must:
        - "Keep public thread open â‰¥ minimal_discussion_days"
        - "Invite counter-arguments (dialectic)"
        - "Publish periodic AI syntheses"
    - step: "testing"
      when: "rule || principle"
      must:
        - "Run in branch/experiment for required period"
        - "Collect metrics and failure cases"
    - step: "decision"
      must:
        - "Verify quorum and threshold"
        - "Publish voting breakdown and rationales"
    - step: "implementation"
      must:
        - "Apply versioning"
        - "Update references"

        - "Schedule rollback window if required"

immutables:
  - "Right to fork cannot be revoked"
  - "Transparency of governance cannot be reduced below public visibility of: proposals, discussions, votes, changelogs"
  - "All governance artifacts must be versioned"
  - "This meta-rule can only be changed via meta_rule path above"

statement: |
  Truth emerges through thesis, antithesis, and synthesis. No single participant
  (human or AI) holds completeness; decisions must be tested by principled opposition.

rationale: |
  Progress comes from surfacing and resolving tensions. Dialectic guards against
  premature consensus and ossification.

requirements:
  - "Every proposal thread invites counter-arguments explicitly"
  - "AI synthesizes perspectives at intervals"
  - "Synthesis must address material concerns before a vote"

  terms: ["discussion", "participant", "consensus"]
